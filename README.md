# Umbrella-share

>This is a Personal Rails capstone project (CRUD)

I don't like carrying umbrella or I never remember to carry one.
When we get stuck in the rain, instead of poping into a convenience store to get one-time use umbrella, we could share an umbrella. It saves time, money and environment.

User who signs in (devise) can check locations of other usrs who have an umbrella nearby and routes (from where to where) via Google map.
The person can talk in a chatroom for details.
